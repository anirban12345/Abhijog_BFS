He sent all documents in his name through whatsapp although the profile picture of the app shows a different person than the photo ID and he said he would send me the advance amount of rent and will stay from 22nd August 2021 in my said flat.\r\n\r\nBut, finally in the evening when he asked me to send Rs. 1 to his account from google pay so that I would be registered under Indian Army\'s bank beneficiary, I got confused and doubted his activity since he gave the account number of IDFC bank which I could not trust upon.

In 2015 I created a facebook profile and was using it. Plenty of my personal photos were there and I have so many friends there. But somehow I forgot the login credential of that said profile and couldn\'t remember or recover it so I created a new profile and started using it.\r\nBut this year on 28th April 2021 I found a post in my facebook timeline stating that Ritu Das got married to Abhishek Mukherjee. The post draws my attention as my husband\'s name is also Abhishek Mukherjee, so I visited that Ritu Das profile and found that it was that profile which I mentioned earlier and saw some of my recent personal photos were also there which must be copied from my current profile. So I suspected that my current profile also got hacked so I took necessary security measures and started looking at Ritu Das profile. Then I noticed that profile name also changed to Ritu Das Mukherjee and realised that someone got access to my old forgotten profile\'s login credential and started disturbing me purposefully and it came true. That person started making posts using my personal photos and tagging my friends.\r\nSo firstly I made a facebook post from my present profile stating the entire matter and tagged Kolkata Police.\r\nThen on 29th April 2021 lodged a general diary at Serampore Police Station vide G.D.E. No. 1424 dated 29-04-2021 and the officer advised me to visit the Cyber Crime Cell at Chuchura to get more help in this matter. Then on 1st May 2021 I visited there and told the concerned officer the entire matter. She took my case and assured me that the profile will be blocked within 72 hours. The next day I found that the profile isn\'t available anymore on facebook so I felt that the problem was over.\r\nBut on 21st June 2021 that profile again becomes live. As LOCKDOWN was running, so I called Cyber Crime Cell Chuchura and informed them of the matter. For my luck the lady officer, who took my case when I visited there, answered my call and assured me that the profile will be blocked again and yes the profile got blocked on the next day.\r\nThen I started to keep an eye on that profile on a regular basis and it wasn\'t visible anymore.\r\nBut today, the 29th August 2021 morning I found the profile is active again. So without wasting time I called up the Cyber Crime Cell Chuchura and informed them of the matter. The officer who answered my call assured me that the profile will be blocked within 72 hours.\r\nNow my concern is why this profile is getting active again and again after getting blocked. I am feeling annoyed by this type of identity threat. Whoever is using this profile can do anything serious using this profile and I will be in serious trouble as once the profile belongs to me and my address is also there.\r\nI would like to request that if there is any permanent solution to de-activate this profile, please let me know.\r\nLink of the said profile: https://www.facebook.com/ritu.das.39142072\r\nMy present profile link: https://www.facebook.com/ritudas511\r\nPlease take necessary action asap in this matter.\r\nA Copy of the GD is attached with this email for your reference.\r\nBest regards,\r\nRitu Das\r\n3/87, Mahesh Colony\r\nSerampore - 712202\r\nHooghly\r\nWest Bengal\r\nMobile: 9163162878, 7439884064','2021-08-29','22:14:00','dritu878@gmail.com; ',7,'She already complaint at Cyber Crime Cell at Chuchura and the matter look after by them.','Yes','Outside of Kolkata Police Jurisdiction','Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes','2021-08-30 09:21:00',1,45),(58,'Written','An unwanted online Ransomware attack and YouTube  & Google Account been hacked.

For more info 7001403197 sent via shine.com”\r\n\r\nOn 8th August, 2021 I called mobile no 7001403197 (as per Truecaller-Bandhan Bank- Identified as Caller No 1) while receiver of this phone has asked me to submit my Resume along with the related supporting documents on his WhatsApp Number (same as above) and accordingly I had done the same through WhatsApp on the same number. Then he asked me to pay Rs. 300/- as application money via NEFT to the beneficiary SUBHRAYATI SEN, S/B Account No. 2149038861, IFSC – CBIN0282013 through NEFT. Accordingly I paid Rs. 300/- by NEFT same day [as per Annexure–II is being enclosed herewith]. On receiving my application fees, he sent me a link (https://globalpvtltd.online) via WhatsApp and advised me to register profile details online. I have successfully registered myself on this portal. Hereafter he informed me to appear for the Online Exam on 9th August 2021 at 14:10 PM.\r\n\r\nOn 9th August, 2021 I appeared the online exam and successfully obtained pass mark as per their Merit List, published next day vide my Roll Number 232091 [as per Annexure-III is enclosed herewith].\r\n\r\nOn 11th August, 2021 another caller, number 9339409313 (as per Truecaller–Sayan Banerjee- Identified as Caller No 2) informed me that I have selected as per Merit List, published in the Website and advised me to pay Rs. 3,250/- as security deposit, which is refundable after joining the service at bank. He also informed me that after payment of the security deposit, I shall get a confirmation letter. Accordingly I have paid Rs. 3,250/- via NEFT on the same day [as per Annexure-IV is enclosed herewith]. They also sent me a Confirmation Letter from their registered email id : career.globalcentral.online, and advised me to resubmit the same duly signed. I have submitted the same with return mail [as per Annexure-V is enclosed herewith].\r\n\r\nOn 13th August 2021 another caller, number 9432689228 (as per TrueCaller-Bandhan Bank Raj Deep Sen-Identified as Caller no 3) asked me to pay Rs. 15,800/- towards Health Insurance premium to get Appointment letter, otherwise candidature will be cancelled. I refused to pay that amount and informed that person to cancel my candidature and I also requested to refund my money back. The person assured me over phone that the entire money will be refunded within the next 3 days.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, again I got a call from Sayan Banerjee (Caller No 2 as referred above) asked me that they have reconsidered the premium at Rs. 5,200/- only and pay immediately to get Appointment letter. He also promised and assured me no need to pay any more Amount. Unfortunately, I have paid Rs. 5,200/- to the same beneficiary on faith according to his assurance [as per Annexure-VI is enclosed herewith]. Hereinafter, I got Appointment letter through their registered email (career.globalcentral.online) from Bandhan Bank on their letterhead “Bandhan Bank 66/2, Ground Floor, Ward No. 22, Dumdum Road, Dist. South Dumdum, West Bengal – 700014” [as per Annexure-VII is enclosed herewith].\r\n\r\nOn 14th August, 2021 again I got a call from mobile number 9339409313 from Sayan Banerjee (Caller No 2 as referred above) and he asked me to pay the balance amount Rs. 10,600/- to get a joining letter. Sir, at this moment I immediately informed that I am unable to pay any further amount and also asked him to refund all the amount paid by me. The caller No 2 Sayan Banerjee told me to get a refund. I have to wait not less than 45 days and it is most harassing to get a refund, better to pay the balance amount and get the job immediately.\r\n\r\nAfter these disordered tele conversations, I enquired at Bandhan Bank, Nagerbazar Branch, they replied that so many people are deceived and called them about these Job Appointments. The  Bank clearly stated that is completely false as there is no such system of employment in their bank and Bank advised me to file FIR at the local PS or file a Complaint at the Cyber Crime Department, Lalbazar directly.\r\n\r\nSir, I am the most victimised person of this fully fraud people who are cheating my hard earned money. So, I request you to kindly look into the matter and do the needful so that at least I can get back my money.\r\n','2021-08-30','04:54:00','( SOUMEN GHOSH ) Mobile No : 9830069528 Email Id : soumengh.ghosh@gmail.com',1,'Email Id : soumengh.ghosh@gmail.com','Yes','On Enquiry','No','Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2021-08-30 20:12:00',1,45),(61,'eMail','Fake job requirement agency at Kolkata.','A Petition from Keral  Police','2021-08-30','05:32:00','Keral Police',1,'cyberpspkd.pol@kerala.gov.in; ','Yes','On Enquiry','No','Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2021-08-30 20:27:00',1,45),(62,'eMail','Misleading Advertisement post on social media platform \r\n','With reference to trailing mail, it is regrettable that even after reporting that fraud advertisements are being done at magicbricks.com, the fraud advertisement is still kept by you in your website posing property owners at risk of frauds over their properties.

Till now from the last 18 months I am unemployed and looking for job, for that I have uploaded my resume in various job sites and trying hard to get any luck.\r\n\r\nIn this regard on 10th of June I got a call from a person named Shantanu claiming he is from GBIC Services PVT LTD and he asked me whether I am looking for a job and I said yes. Then he asked me about my educational qualification and experience and offered me a job in Netherlands for a company called Glomar Offshore BV saying in July you will face the interview once you will be shortlisted by the client. Before send your cv and documents to our mail id which I did. Then after some days Shantanu said ok your cv is selected and your interview will be conducted on this date. I got an interview call from an Netherlands no +3197005035152, a lady claiming to be the HR of Glomar Offshore took my interview and she had good idea about my job and after successful interview she offered me the salary and all. Then I got the selection mail from Glomar offshore on 06/08/2021 (attached) and they asked me to submit documents for verification like education, experience certificates, passport copy etc. I gave and after some day on 20/08/2021 I got the contract letter in which they had written like due to covid terms candidate had to do PCC, medicals, travel insurance, visa stamping and return tickets to Amsterdam and this will be reimbursed once I will submit my NRI account. For this reason I did not doubted them and paid for all the expenses knowing company will reimburse everything. In this time I sent them 20,000 + 20,000 + 42,855 + 20,000 = 102855 in the account number they sent me. I was getting mails from mail@hrglomaroffshore.com and I was getting instructions what to do, first they said proceed with PCC for Netherlands , and then proceed with DG Shipping ILO medical and I did my medicals too. Then they asked to do travel and visa stamping and then return ticket of Kolkata to Amsterdam from GBIC services and send the screenshot of transactions to them as bill/receipt so that later on they will reimburse in my NRI account.\r\n\r\nI was hesitant in paying travel tickets because I had no money, I borrowed from my friends and paid to them. In mail they said I will get my flight PNR and visa letter on 28/08/2021. Shantanu said once you get the visa letter you can open NRI account on the same day and your money will be transferred same day from the company and he also told me to do notary of the documents once I get the visa letter and after notary I will have to go to Mumbai for visa stamping, for which they said my slot has been booked on 06/09/2021 in VFS Global Mumbai.\r\n\r\nMy last payment to shantanu was on 25/08/2021 after that he was not replying to my whatsapp and not taking calls.\r\n\r\nOn 28/08/2021 Shantanu deleted his whatsapp account and switched off his phone. GBIC website had 4 contact numbers and all was switched off. The mail id ( mail@glomaroffshore.com) was also deleted and when I mailed about the status of my visa I got a reply from gmail that this mail ID does not exist or unable to receive your mail.
